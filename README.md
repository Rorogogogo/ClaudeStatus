# Notchy

**A tiny, native macOS notch indicator for [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code), Codex, and Antigravity.**

Glance at your notch. Know if your agent is working, waiting on you, or idle.
Hover for live 5h / weekly usage — the exact numbers `/usage` would show.

## ✨ Highlights

- 🟢 **Live agent status** — green = working · yellow = waiting on you · gray = idle
- 📊 **Real usage, not estimates** — same numbers Claude Code's `/usage` shows, with reset countdowns
- 🤝 **Multi-agent support** — Claude Code, Codex, **and** Antigravity (Gemini CLI) in the same pill
- 🪶 **Featherweight** — ~0.1 % idle CPU, ~32 MB RSS, ~220 KB binary
- 🛜 **Zero network calls** — everything is file-watched locally via `kqueue`
- 🌗 **Native macOS** — single Swift binary, no Electron, no Python, no 60 Hz redraw loops
- 👻 **Stays out of the way** — auto-hides after 10 min, reappears the instant a hook fires

<br />

## 🪟 What it looks like

A small black notch-shaped pill, slightly wider than the physical notch:

- 🦀 Coral Claude-style crab on the left — or the Codex mark, or the Antigravity sparkle, depending on which agent updated most recently
- A colored status dot on the right:
  - 🟢 **green** — working (you sent a prompt, agent is generating or running a tool)
  - 🟡 **yellow** — waiting on you (permission prompt or other input)
  - ⚪ **gray** — idle (last turn finished cleanly)

Hover the pill to expand Dynamic-Island-style and reveal:

- **5h block** usage with a 16-segment bar and reset countdown (Claude & Codex)
- **This week** usage with a 16-segment bar and reset countdown (Claude & Codex)
- A status-only row for Antigravity (agent · project · status — Antigravity exposes no quota to chart)
- Current project + status, with a one-click quit button

<br />

## ⚖️ How Notchy compares

There are a few notch-style "vibe coding" indicators out there. Here's how Notchy stacks up against the rough category average — no names, just patterns we've seen.

| | **Notchy** | Typical notch indicator |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime | Single native Swift binary | Electron / web view / Python wrapper |
| Idle CPU | ~0.1 % | 2 – 10 % (per-frame redraws, polling loops) |
| Memory | ~32 MB RSS | 150 – 400 MB |
| Binary size | ~220 KB | 80 – 250 MB |
| Update mechanism | `kqueue` file watch, event-driven | Timer polling, often 1 – 60 Hz |
| Usage numbers | Real `/usage` values via statusline JSON | Estimated, scraped, or absent |
| Network calls | None | Often polls a vendor API |
| Reset countdowns | ✅ Exact (from server) | ❌ or approximate |
| Multi-agent (Claude Code + Codex + Antigravity) | ✅ All three, side by side | Usually one only |
| Notch-shape geometry | Matches Dynamic Island curves | Often a flat rectangle floating below |
| Auto-hide when idle | ✅ After 10 min, instant wake on hook | Often always-on |
| Click-through outside pill | ✅ Hit-tested to the visible shape | ❌ Whole bounding box blocks clicks |
| Install footprint | One `.pkg`, scripts under `~/.claude`, `~/.codex` & `~/.gemini` | App + helper daemons + login items |

The short version: most existing tools are great-looking demos built on web stacks. Notchy is what you'd build if you wanted the same idea to disappear into the OS — quiet, native, and accurate.

<br />

## 📈 Live usage data

The 5h-block and weekly percentages are **the same numbers** Claude Code's built-in `/usage` shows — including the precise reset times. Notchy doesn't estimate, it doesn't poll Anthropic, it doesn't need an admin API key.

It works by tapping the JSON Claude Code already pipes to your **statusline command** on every TUI render. That JSON contains:

```json
"rate_limits": {
  "five_hour":  { "used_percentage": 52, "resets_at": 1778767200 },
  "seven_day":  { "used_percentage": 33, "resets_at": 1779087600 }
}
```

Notchy's installer adds a 10-line writer block to your `~/.claude/statusline-command.sh` (or creates a minimal one if you have none) that extracts those fields into `~/.claude/state/usage`. The app file-watches that path with `kqueue` and re-renders the bars when it changes. **Zero polling, zero network calls.**

Numbers refresh on every statusline render (i.e. while a TUI is active). When no TUI is open, the last known numbers stay on screen until the next render.

For Codex, Notchy reads the latest local session `token_count` event that includes `rate_limits`, then writes the same usage format to `~/.codex/notchy/usage`. This gives the Codex row its own 5h and weekly usage bars without network calls.

Antigravity (Gemini CLI / `agy`) is **status-only**: it doesn't expose a 5h/weekly quota anywhere we can read, so its row shows agent · project · status with no usage bars rather than fabricating numbers. If a future Antigravity release surfaces real quota, the same writer pattern slots straight in.

<br />

## 📦 Requirements

- macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later
- A MacBook with a notch (M-series 14"/16" Pro, M3 Air, etc.)
- Any of Claude Code, Codex, and/or Antigravity (Gemini CLI) installed
- `jq` on `PATH` (preinstalled on most dev machines; `brew install jq` if missing) — needed for Claude/Codex live usage
- `python3` on `PATH` for Codex/Antigravity project-name parsing (optional — status still works without it, just with a blank project)
- For building from source: Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)

<br />

## 🚀 Install (from the .pkg)

1. Download `Notchy.pkg` from the [Releases](https://github.com/Rorogogogo/Notchy/releases) page.
2. Double-click. macOS will show "Notchy.pkg cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer."
3. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll to the message about Notchy, click **Open Anyway**.
4. Walk through the macOS Installer.
5. **Restart any running Claude Code and/or Codex CLI sessions.** Hooks and the statusline command only load at session start.

> The package is ad-hoc signed (free) but not notarized (requires a paid Apple Developer account). That's why you need the one-time "Open Anyway" step.

The installer's postinstall script will:

- Copy the app to `/Applications/Notchy.app`
- Install scripts to `~/.claude/notchy/` (`play.sh` for status hooks, `statusline.sh` for live usage)
- Install Codex scripts to `~/.codex/notchy/` (`play.sh` for status hooks, `usage.sh` for live usage)
- Install the Antigravity script to `~/.gemini/notchy/` (`play.sh` for status hooks)
- Merge Claude Code hook entries into `~/.claude/settings.json` (existing hooks preserved)
- Enable Codex lifecycle hooks in `~/.codex/config.toml`
- Merge Notchy Codex hook entries into `~/.codex/hooks.json`
- Merge Notchy Antigravity hook entries into `~/.gemini/config/hooks.json` (existing hooks preserved)
- Append a marked writer block to your existing `~/.claude/statusline-command.sh`, or register a minimal one if you don't have a statusline configured
- Write a LaunchAgent at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.notchy.app.plist`
- Start the app immediately and on every login
- Clean up any artifacts from the legacy `ClaudeStatus` build

Re-running the installer is safe — hooks and writer blocks are detected by marker comments and replaced, not duplicated.

<br />

## 🛠️ Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rorogogogo/Notchy.git
cd Notchy
./build.sh
```

Outputs:
- `build/pkg-root/Applications/Notchy.app` — the standalone app
- `build/Notchy.pkg` — the installer

<br />

## 🔬 How it works

Seven pieces:

1. **`play.sh`** — invoked by Claude Code hook events. Reads the hook payload from stdin, writes `<status>\t<unix_ts>\t<project_name>\n` to `~/.claude/state/status`. ~20 ms per invocation.

2. **Statusline writer** — a 10-line block injected into your `~/.claude/statusline-command.sh`. Each statusline render, it pulls `rate_limits` from the JSON Claude Code piped to stdin and writes `<block_pct>\t<block_reset>\t<weekly_pct>\t<weekly_reset>\n` to `~/.claude/state/usage`. Runs in `&` background so your statusline render isn't blocked.

3. **`~/.claude/state/{status,usage}`** — two single-line text files for Claude Code status and usage.

4. **`~/.codex/notchy/play.sh`** — invoked by Codex lifecycle hooks. Reads the hook payload from stdin and writes Codex status updates to `~/.codex/notchy/status`.

5. **`~/.codex/notchy/usage.sh`** — scans recent Codex session JSONL files for the latest `token_count.rate_limits` event and writes `<block_pct>\t<block_reset>\t<weekly_pct>\t<weekly_reset>\n` to `~/.codex/notchy/usage`.

6. **`~/.gemini/notchy/play.sh`** — invoked by Antigravity (Gemini CLI) hook events. Reads the hook payload from stdin and writes `<status>\t<unix_ts>\t<project_name>\n` to `~/.gemini/notchy/status`. Status-only; no usage file.

7. **`Notchy.app`** — a long-running native macOS app:
   - Floating `NSPanel` over the physical notch, level above the menu bar
   - Notch-shaped pill drawn with a custom `Shape` (top corners 6pt inward, bottom 14pt outward when collapsed, 22pt when expanded — same curves as the iPhone Dynamic Island)
   - File-watches Claude Code status/usage, Codex status/usage, and Antigravity status with `DispatchSource.makeFileSystemObjectSource` (kqueue under the hood). Re-renders only when the kernel fires `VNODE_WRITE`.
   - Hover detection constrained to the visible pill shape via `.contentShape(NotchShape(...))`, so transparent areas around the pill don't block clicks to apps below.
   - Spring-animated expansion: ~0.32 s response, 0.78 damping.
   - Auto-expires `waiting` → `idle` after 3 s (see [Caveats](#-caveats)).

<br />

## 🪝 Hooks installed

| Claude Code event | Sets status to |
|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | working |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | working |
| `PreToolUse` | working |
| `PostToolUse` | working |
| `PostToolUseFailure` | working |
| `Stop` | idle |
| `StopFailure` | idle |
| `Notification` | waiting |
| `PermissionRequest` | waiting |

Codex registers the same set of events in `~/.codex/hooks.json`.

**Antigravity** registers the same events in `~/.gemini/config/hooks.json`, but `agy` only recognizes three of them — `PreToolUse` → working, `PostToolUse` → working, `Stop` → idle. It has no notification/permission hook, so the Antigravity dot goes green while a tool runs and gray when the turn ends, but **never yellow** (see [Caveats](#-caveats)). The extra entries are harmless — `agy` ignores the ones it doesn't know.

<br />

## ⚠️ Caveats

- **No hook fires when the user denies a permission prompt** ([per the docs](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks)). Notchy handles this by auto-expiring `waiting` → `idle` after 3 seconds with no further events.
- **Live usage only refreshes while a TUI is active.** Anthropic only sends `rate_limits` in the statusline JSON during an interactive session. When no `claude` TUI is open, the bars freeze at the last known values until the next render.
- **Codex usage refreshes from local session logs.** The Codex bars update after Codex emits a `token_count` event with `rate_limits`; before that, the row shows the last known values.
- **`rate_limits` only appears after the first API response** in a session. Open a fresh TUI without sending anything, and the bars stay on whatever the previous render left.
- **Hooks load at session start.** After installing (or reconfiguring), restart any running Claude Code session.
- **Codex hooks require a restart.** Restart any running Codex CLI session after installing or reconfiguring Notchy.
- **Antigravity has no usage bars and never shows yellow.** `agy` exposes no 5h/weekly quota to read (so the row is status-only), and it fires no notification/permission hook — only `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse`/`Stop`. The dot is green during tool use and gray when idle; a permission prompt won't turn it yellow because `agy` sends no event for it.
- **Antigravity hooks require a restart.** Restart any running Antigravity (Gemini CLI) session after installing or reconfiguring Notchy.
- **Codex prompts you to trust each hook the first time it runs.** Codex stores a `trusted_hash` per hook in `~/.codex/config.toml` and asks for approval the first time it sees a new (or changed) hook command. You'll see one prompt per lifecycle event (`SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Stop`, `Notification`, `PermissionRequest`, etc.) — approve to let Notchy receive status updates. Codex's hook review UI numbers hooks by order (`Hook 1`, `Hook 2`, etc.); Notchy adds `statusMessage` labels to its hook commands, but Codex still controls the row title. Re-running the installer with updated hook metadata will re-prompt because the hash changes.
- **First-launch Gatekeeper warning.** The `.pkg` isn't notarized — Privacy & Security → "Open Anyway" the first time.
- **Notch-only.** Older / non-notch displays still get a pill at the top center, but it looks less like a natural notch extension.

<br />

## 🧹 Uninstall

```bash
launchctl bootout "gui/$(id -u)/com.notchy.app" 2>/dev/null
rm -rf /Applications/Notchy.app
rm -f ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.notchy.app.plist
rm -rf ~/.claude/notchy
rm -rf ~/.codex/notchy
rm -rf ~/.gemini/notchy
```

Then strip the writer block from `~/.claude/statusline-command.sh` (look for the `# notchy-writer-begin` … `# notchy-writer-end` markers) and remove the Notchy hook entries from `~/.claude/settings.json` (they all reference `~/.claude/notchy/play.sh`).

For Codex, remove the Notchy hook entries from `~/.codex/hooks.json` (they reference `~/.codex/notchy/play.sh`). The `hooks = true` setting in `~/.codex/config.toml` can be left enabled if you use other Codex hooks, or removed if Notchy was the only reason it was enabled.

For Antigravity, remove the Notchy hook entries from `~/.gemini/config/hooks.json` (they reference `~/.gemini/notchy/play.sh`).
